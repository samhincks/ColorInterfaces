# colorinterfaces
This open source project seeks to create technology for discovering and utilizing a 3-dimensional color and motion representation of music. 


# mission
When the code is complete, the process of producing moving color music from a sound source will be fully automated. A set of neural networks trained to encode a template for the perceptual structures of the brain will automatically extract directions for how to change the color of light sources and move sounds around a speaker array. 

In the interem, there is a large group of interrelated programs to be written for empowering creatives as they render the aesthetic of their Perception. 

The aim of the Color Interface project is to Unite creatives through synesthetic software.
