# mission
The Color Interface initiative seeks to define and develop User Interfaces for Thought and Sensation in software, hardware, music, art, language, science, and spirituality. These threads are united by a common ontology for Brain-World Interfacing derived from machine learning models of perception, especially the Free Energy Principle articulated by Karl Friston. 

# software
When the code is complete, the process of producing moving color music from a sound source will be fully automated. 

In the interem, there is a large group of interrelated programs to be written for empowering creatives as they render the aesthetic of their Perception. This github repository will include 

A set of neural networks trained to encode a template for the perceptual structures of the brain will automatically extract directions for how to change the color of light sources and move sounds around a speaker array. 

The aim of the Color Interface project is to Unite creatives through synesthetic software.
